# Grimoire
 An app for tracking recipes and making shopping lists.

 App has two main goals: serving as a general-purpose recipe tracker that is content-agonistic, meaning it can store any type of ingredient from a user-declared list, 
 as well as a shopping list generated from selected recipes in your repertoire. The app is meant to be clean and simple to use, much like a pen-and-paper approach.

 Besides this basic functionality, there are plans to implement a 'multiplier' to the shopping list function. This allows the user to adjust recipe size based on their needs.

Initial commit:
Added a skeleton code, initial file structure as well as basic interactions between pages. Code still doesn't properly run - have to fix broken relationships between .xamls and code-behinds.
